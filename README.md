# CompLF

This is an implementation of a theory-agnostic bidirectional typing algorithm for the well-moded theories of CompLF.

CompLF is a logical framework suitable for defining computational theories, that is, those whose definitional equality is purely generated by rewriting rules (similar to Dedukti). Its main distinguishing features are

- Canonical forms: When defining systems in most logical frameworks, one generally obtain 

- Minimal syntax: In most logical frameworks, when defining for instance sigma types, we will pose constants `mkSig : (A : Ty) (B : Tm A -> Ty) -> Tm Sig(A, x. B)`, `pi1 : (A : Ty) (B : Tm A -> Ty) (t : Tm Sig(A, x. B)) : Tm A` and `pi1 : (A : Ty) (B : Tm A -> Ty) (t : Tm Sig(A, x. B)) : Tm A`

The file `test/test.complf` gives an introduction to CompLF and its functionalities. You can run `make test` in order to see the output it produces.

## Implementation

The implementation of rewriting uses a form of NbE and is inspired by the following works.

- A simple type-theoretic language: Mini-TT
