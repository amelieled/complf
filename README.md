# CompLF

This is an implementation of a theory-agnostic bidirectional typing algorithm for the well-moded theories of CompLF.

CompLF is a logical framework suitable for defining computational theories, that is, those whose definitional equality is purely generated by rewriting rules (similar to Dedukti). Its main distinguishing features are

- Canonical forms: When defining systems in most logical frameworks, one generally obtain 

- Minimal syntax: In most logical frameworks, when defining for instance sigma types, we will pose constants `mkSig : (A : Ty) (B : Tm A -> Ty) -> Tm Sig(A, x. B)`, `pi1 : (A : Ty) (B : Tm A -> Ty) (t : Tm Sig(A, x. B)) : Tm A` and `pi1 : (A : Ty) (B : Tm A -> Ty) (t : Tm Sig(A, x. B)) : Tm A`

The file `test/quick_intro.complf` gives an introduction to CompLF. You can run `make test` in order to see the output it produces. If you want a more detailed introduction, look at the file `test/intro.complf` which explains a bit more some technical parts. The full definition of CompLF, its metatheory, the bidirectional typing algorithm, and its soundness and correctness proofs are the subject of an article currently in preparation. A link will be added here as soon as it becomes available.

## Implementation

The implementation of rewriting uses a form of NbE and is inspired by the following works.

- A simple type-theoretic language: Mini-TT
